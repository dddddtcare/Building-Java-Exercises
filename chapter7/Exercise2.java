 /*Write a method called range that returns the range of values in an array of integers. The range is defined as 1 more
than the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array. For example, if an array called list
contains the values {36, 12, 25, 19, 46, 31, 22}, the call of range(list) should return 35 (46  12  1). You may
assume that the array has at least one element*/
